In this folder you will find two python scripts and the report.
there was some issues with pandas import when running the scripts directly in
visualstudio code, so  would recommend to run it directly in terminal.
In order to run the scripts you need to 
install following imports:
pandas
numpy
random
sklearn.model_selection

These can be installed using pip in the terminal

Preprocession:
This script handels all the handeling of the data, so that it's
ready to be used on the ML model. 

LogisticRegression:
this script is a class representing a logistic regression. there is
also some print lines about the results, these are of course in the report
as well.
